A simple **Library Management System** built using **Java** and **ArrayList** for temporary book management. This system allows users to **add**, **view**, **search**, **update**, and **delete books**.

## Features
- **Add a Book**: Allows you to add a new book with unique Book ID, Title, Author, Genre, and Availability Status.

- **View All Books**: Displays a list of all books currently in the system.

- **Search a Book**: Search for a book using its ID or Title.

- **Update Book Details**: Modify book details like title, author, and availability status.
